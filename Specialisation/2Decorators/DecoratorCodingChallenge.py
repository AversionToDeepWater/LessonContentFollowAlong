"""
Create a Decorator that tells you how long a function
has taken to run.

It should be called as @timer.

To do this, you'll need the `time` library imported.
the time library has many utilities within it,
consider using time.perf_counter(), but you may find another
alternative to this.

Maths hint:
To get the time between two moments,
subtract the start time away from the end time.

e.g:
I started timing at 16:36
I finished timing at 16:46

46 - 36 = 10
ðŸ‘† a ten minute time difference.

However, your timer is going to be working with really
small time periods!
