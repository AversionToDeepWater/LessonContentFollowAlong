Challenge 1 is to complete the terminal input for price
calculations for our OdemaxCiniVue customers.

The rules are:
Custom Exceptions/ Validation:
- Children under 3 years old are not permitted into the Cinema.
- No one can earn negative money a year.
Logic:
- Children aged 3 to 12 receive the Child Discount.

- If a user earns less than Â£12,500 a year, and is not a child
or a pensioner, they are entitled to a free ticket.
